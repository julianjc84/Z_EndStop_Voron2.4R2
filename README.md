# Z_EndStop_Voron2.4R2
Voron2.4r2 Z_EndStop

The original zEndstopSTL that comes with the Voron2.4r2 is too large and protudes above and bellow the 20x20 linear rail.
there is a Compressed, Narrow version out there but that is still too large.

i have redrawn the Z_EndStop base to cleanly fit between the 20x20 rail without touching the base. Some of us use a ACM or AliGloss aluminium coated panel that shorts the switch out if touched, and if the Z_EndStop protudes past the linear rail it pushes down the base sheet.
