# Z_EndStop_Voron2.4R2
Voron2.4r2 Z_EndStop STL

The original z_EndstopStop that listed on the VORON Git is too large and protudes above and bellow the 20x20 linear rails.
there is also a Compressed/Narrow version out there but that is still too large!.

I have redrawn the Z_EndStop to cleanly fit between the 20x20 rail without touching the base. Some users use a ACM or AliGloss aluminium coated panel that shorts the switch out if touched and if the Z_EndStop protudes past the linear rail it pushes down the sheet.

This STL is designed to fit perfectly
